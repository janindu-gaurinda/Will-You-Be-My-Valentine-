# Will-You-Be-My-Valentine-

This project is a playful Valentine's Day page with a personalized proposal interaction. The user is presented with a cute animated GIF and two buttons: "YES" and "NO." If the user selects "NO," the page dynamically changes the button text and increases the font size of the "YES" button in a fun way. The "YES" button redirects to a new page (or performs other actions).

Features:
Animated GIF for a playful touch
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
"YES" and "NO" interactive buttons
Dynamic message display for the "NO" button
Fun font size change on button interaction
